## ‚ÑπÔ∏è A Simple Newspaper Article Landing Page

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project replicates the classic layout and feel of a vintage newspaper article using only HTML and CSS. With careful attention to typography, spacing, and alignment, it mimics the columned, print-style presentation found in traditional publications.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## üîç Overview

The Newspaper Article project is a layout exercise that practices semantic HTML and advanced text formatting using CSS. It includes a simulated article layout with a title, date, subheading, byline, and several paragraphs of content.

This project emphasizes good use of margin, padding, text indenting, drop caps, shadows, and font choices. It also explores how to center content, apply soft visual effects, and create a clean, readable interface for long-form text.
